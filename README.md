# Sign Language Recognizer
[American Sign Language (ASL)](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language) is a complete, natural language that has the same linguistic properties as spoken languages, with grammar that differs from English. ASL is expressed by movements of the hands and face. It is the primary language of many North Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing and is used by some hearing people as well.

## Goal
We created a model that is able to recognize different American sign language gestures and translate them to text. The model is embedded within a simple User Interface. Our model is able to accurately classify 43 different gestures. The gestures are:
* A - Z
* 1 - 10
* Some phrases such as (Thank You, HI, I Love You, Yes, No, My, Name)
